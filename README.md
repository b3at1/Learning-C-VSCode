# Learning-C-VSCode
## Introduction
I wanted to learn some basic C syntax, these are project files I've made to learn. BallMart (storeFront.c) is the main project that I've been working on.
## What is it?
BallMart is a simple program that uses a command-line interface to sell items to the user. You can purchase balls based on price and quantity.
Be warned the .exe is still a bit buggy, and the binary is even worse. This is just my first attempt writing something in C so it's not very good.
